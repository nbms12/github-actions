Github Action With CICD Pipeline

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.I've created a workflow that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

in below application created a sample math operator app where it solves basic operations such as addition, substraction and multiply. and unit tests to test some cases.
